# Webex Teams Modular Input

Authors: Datapunctum GmbH
Description: Webex Teams Modular Input
Version: 1.0.3

## Introduction

The purpose of this add-on is to collect Webex Teams Events and Webex Teams Audit-Events through the [Webex Teams API](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started)

This Add-on has been built using the Splunk Add-on Builder

## Special Features

* If files have been uploaded in a message, the event can be enriched with file information.
* If rooms have been created, the event can be enriched with the room title.
* Messages can be masked for privacy

## Authentication

Authentication to the API is through Personal Access Tokens. An Personal Access Token can be acquired through a Refresh Token, which has to be renewed once a while.
##### v1.0.1
The Add-on expects an active Refresh Tokens and keeps track of the lifetime of the Access Token and automatically refreshes the access token if needed.

Additionally to the Refresh Token, the Client ID and Client Secret has to be provided.

Multiple Refresh Tokens with different access rights.(up to 4) may be configured and referenced by Inputs.

##### v.1.0.3
In this version, the Add-on integrates the OAuth flow to get the Access Token and a Refresh Token in the configuration phase, and keeps track of the lifetime of the Access Token and automatically refreshes the access token if needed.

#### Create a Webex Teams OAuth Integration App

An integration is what you'd have to use if you have Single Sign-On (SSO) or OAuth enabled in your Webex account and you are not able to create a Service Account. 
- Log in to [Cisco Webex for Developers](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/integration) using a Webex Account with `compliance officer` Role.
(This Add-on will hit the Webex teamsâ€™s Events API endpoint, which requires the `Spark-compliance:events_read` scope. In order to use the `Spark-compliance:events_read` scope you need to be a designated `compliance officer` for your organization in Webex Control Hub. Please make sure the account you used to create this integration has been assigned this role. You can assign this role to a user in [Webex Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com/).)

- Enter the following details:
    - **Integration name**: Enter a integration name as you like. 
    - **Contact email**: Enter a contact email address.
    - **Icon**: Select a default Icon
    - **Description**: Write a description of your integration
    - **Redirect URI**: The Redirect URI **MUST** follow this pattern:

    ```https://{{hostname}}/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/webex-teams-oauth```

    Please replace the `{{hostname}}` with the hostname of your Splunk Heavy Forwarder (or IDM). For example, if the hostname of your HF or IDM is `example.splunk.link`, the Redirect URI you have to enter is:
    
    `https://example.splunk.link/en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/webex-teams-oauth`
    
    **Note**: If your Splunk site is not in `en-US`, please change it to your true value. 
    - **Scope**: Please select these three options 
       - Spark:all
       - Audit:events_read
       - Spark-compliance:events_read
- Click on `Add Integration` button.
- Please copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` somewhere for further use.
